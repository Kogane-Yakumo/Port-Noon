Port Noon is a custom Magic: the Gathering set, retelling the world of Weather Factory's Cultist Simulator and Book of Hours, with several separations & alterations to the world to fall more inline with Magic's fantasy aesthetic. It's mechanical themes include disposable creatures and Gods.

The set includes a couple of custom mechanics:
Induct (Create a 0/1 Cleric creature token with “Sacrifice two other Clerics: Transform this creature.” It transforms into a 4/4 God Horror creature token that can’t block.)
Scars (They're boons with “When a creature you control dies, you may pay 1. If you do, draw a card.”)
